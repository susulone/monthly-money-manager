## About this project<a name="about"></a>

This project is a frontend budgeting aplication. This application will be implementing the the idea of a zero-based budget.

The idea of this budgeting method is:

“Zero-based budgeting is when your income minus your expenses equals zero.”

The goal of this strategy isn’t to spend everything you make — it’s designed to ensure that every single dollar is accounted for, and not just floating around in your checking account waiting to be spent on an impulse purchase.

## Used framewoks and libraries<a name= "frameworks-libraries"></a>
